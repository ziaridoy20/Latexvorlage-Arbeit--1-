	abstract = {Full electronic automation in stock exchanges has recently become popular, generating high-frequency intraday data and motivating the development of near real-time price forecasting methods. Machine learning algorithms are widely applied to midprice stock predictions. Processing raw data as inputs for prediction models (e.g., data thinning and feature engineering) can primarily affect the performance of the prediction methods. However, researchers rarely discuss this topic. This motivated us to propose three novel modelling strategies for processing raw data. We illustrate how our novel modelling strategies improve forecasting performance by analyzing high-frequency data of the Dow Jones 30 component stocks. In these experiments, our strategies often lead to statistically significant improvement in predictions. The three strategies improve the F1 scores of the SVM models by 0.056, 0.087, and 0.016, respectively.},

In particular, we provide a unified and therefore unique treatment that covers the full breadth of portfolio optimization problems, including, for instance, the allocation of resources to financial assets and the selection of indivisible assets such as R\&D projects. We also identify opportunities for future methodological and applied research, hoping to inspire researchers to contribute to the growing field of portfolio optimization.},

	abstract = {Building an investment portfolio is a problem that numerous researchers have addressed for many years. The key goal has always been to balance risk and reward by optimally allocating assets such as stocks, bonds, and cash. In general, the portfolio management process is based on three steps: planning, execution, and feedback, each of which has its objectives and methods to be employed. Starting from Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio theory, different frameworks have been widely accepted, which considerably renewed how asset allocation is being solved. Recent advances in artificial intelligence provide methodological and technological capabilities to solve highly complex problems, and investment portfolio is no exception. For this reason, the paper reviews the current state-of-the-art approaches by answering the core question of how artificial intelligence is transforming portfolio management steps. Moreover, as the use of artificial intelligence in finance is challenged by transparency, fairness and explainability requirements, the case study of

For example, summarization models are often trained to predict human reference summaries and evaluated using ROUGE, but both of these metrics are rough proxies for what we really care about—summary quality. In this work, we show that it is possible to signiﬁcantly improve summary quality by training a model to optimize for human preferences. We collect a large, high-quality dataset of human comparisons between summaries, train a model to predict the human-preferred summary, and use that model as a reward function to ﬁne-tune a summarization policy using reinforcement learning. We apply our method to a version of the TL;DR dataset of Reddit posts [63] and ﬁnd that our models signiﬁcantly outperform both human reference summaries and much larger models ﬁne-tuned with supervised learning alone. Our models also transfer to CNN/DM news articles [22], producing summaries nearly as good as the human reference without any news-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning.2 We conduct extensive analyses to understand our human feedback dataset and ﬁne-tuned models.3 We establish that our reward model generalizes to new datasets, and that optimizing our reward model results in better summaries than optimizing ROUGE according to humans. We hope the evidence from our paper motivates machine learning researchers to pay closer attention to how their training loss affects the model behavior they actually want.},

            We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premiums. We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature. We identify the best-performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowing nonlinear predictor interactions missed by other methods. All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals, a set that includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.

This paper uses quadratic programming algorithms and genetic algorithms as well as quadratic programming algorithms, Matlab planning solutions for genetic algorithms, and genetic algorithm toolboxes to solve Markowitz’s mean variance model. The mathematical model for introducing sparse portfolio strategies uses the decomposition method of penalty functions as an algorithm for solving nonconvex sparse optimization strategies to solve financial portfolio problems. The merging speed of the quadratic programming algorithm is fast, and the merging speed depends on the selection of the initial value. The genetic algorithm performs very well in global searches, but local search capabilities are insufficient and the pace of integration into the next stage is slow. To solve this, using a genetic algorithm toolbox is quick and easy. The results of the experiments show that the final solution of the decomposition method of the fine function is consistent with the solution of the integrity of the genetic algorithm. 67\% of the total funds will be spent on local car reserves and 33\% on wine reserves. When data scales are small, quadratic programming algorithms and genetic algorithms can provide effective portfolio feedback, and the method of breaking down penalty functions to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of algorithm combinations is widely used in sparse financial portfolio issues.},

We extend the standard model to include cardinality constraints that limit a portfolio to have a speci"ed number of assets, and to impose limits on the proportion of the portfolio held in a given asset (if any of the asset is held). We illustrate the di!erences that arise in the shape of this e\$cient frontier when such constraints are present. We present three heuristic algorithms based upon genetic algorithms, tabu search and simulated annealing for "nding the cardinality constrained e\$cient frontier. Computational results are presented for "ve data sets involving up to 225 assets.},

	abstract = {In this contribution we propose to solve complex portfolio selection problems via Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) that resort to adaptive parameter control to manage the Exploration versus Exploitation balance and to find (near)-optimal solutions. This strategy modifies the algorithm’s parameters during execution, and relies on continuous feedbacks provided to the EA with respect to some user-defined criteria. In particular, our study aims to understand whether a standard EA can benefit from a robust method that iteratively selects the crossover operator out of a predefined set, in the context of optimised portfolio choices. We apply this approach to large-scale optimization problems, by tackling a number of NP-hard mixed-integer programming problems. Our results show that generic EAs equipped with single crossover operator do not perform homogeneously across problem instances, whereas the adaptive policy leads to robust (and improved) solutions, by alternating exploration and exploitation on the basis of the features of the current search space.},

	abstract = {The investment portfolio optimization issues have been widely discussed by scholars for more than 60 years. One of the key issues that emerge for researchers is to clarify which optimization approach helps to build the most efficient portfolio (in this case, the efficiency refers to the minimization of the investment risk and the maximization of the return). The objective of the study is to assess the fitness of a genetic algorithm approach in optimizing the investment portfolio. The paper analyzes the theoretical aspects of applying a genetic algorithm-based approach, then it adapts them to practical research. To build an investment portfolio, four Lithuanian enterprises listed on the OMX Baltics Stock Exchange Official List were selected in accordance with the chosen criteria. Then, by applying a genetic algorithm-based approach and using MatLab software, the optimum investment portfolio was constructed from the selected enterprises. The research results showed that the genetic algorithm-based portfolio in 2013 reached a better risk-return ratio than the portfolio optimized by the deterministic and stochastic programing methods. Also, better outcomes were achieved in comparison with the OMX Baltic Market Index. As a result, the hypothesis of the superiority of a portfolio, optimized on the basis of a genetic algorithm, is not rejected. However, it should be noted that in seeking for more reliable conclusions, further research should include more trial periods as the current study examined a period of one year. In this context, the operation of the approach in the context of a market downturn could be of particular interest.},

Three most popular random mutation techniques such as uniform mutation, Gaussian mutation and boundary mutation, two recently introduced individual adaptive mutation techniques, a self-adaptive mutation technique and a deterministic mutation technique are taken to carry out the analysis. A common experimental bench of benchmark test functions is used to test the techniques and the results are analysed. The analysis intends to identify a best mutation technique for every benchmark problem and to understand the dependency behaviour of mutation techniques with other genetic algorithm parameters such as population sizes, crossover rates and number of generations. Based on the analytical results, interesting findings are obtained that would improve the performance of genetic algorithm.},
